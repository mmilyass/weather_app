Weather App 🌤️

This is a responsive Weather App built using HTML, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS. It fetches weather data from the Open-Meteo API
 and displays:

Current weather with temperature, weather icon, and location

Additional metrics: “feels like” temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation

7-day forecast with high/low temperatures and icons

Hourly forecast with a day selector

Unit toggling between Imperial and Metric (°C/°F, km/h/mph, mm)

The app is fully responsive and includes smooth UI interactions thanks to Tailwind CSS utility classes.
